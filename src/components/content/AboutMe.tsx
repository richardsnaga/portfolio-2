        I'm a Software Developer with over 3 years of experience and a passion for tackling complex technical challenges through elegant, efficient algorithmic solutions.

      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-foreground dark:text-white mt-4">
        My journey began with 1.5 years in web development at a consulting firm, where I built a strong foundation in Python, AngularJS, Docker, PostgreSQL, RethinkDB, and Linux. I then spent more than 2 years at another consultancy, honing my expertise in Java Spring Boot, Vue, and TypeScript, while gaining deep insights into e-procurement systems.

      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-foreground dark:text-white mt-4">
        I thrive on creating systems that not only work flawlessly but are also easy to operate and highly efficient. Today, my focus extends beyond building web applications â€” Iâ€™m committed to ensuring they run at peak performance. Iâ€™m currently exploring modern approaches to application performance and traffic management with Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring the solutions I build are both scalable and reliable.
